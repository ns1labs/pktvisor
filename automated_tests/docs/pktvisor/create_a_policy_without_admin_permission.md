## Scenario: Create a policy without admin permission

## Steps:
- Provide a pktvisor instance using `docker run --net=host -d ns1labs/pktvisor pktvisord <net_interface>`
- Try to create a policy through a post request on the endpoint: `/api/v1/policies`
- Make a get request to the same endpoint

## Expected Result:
- pktvisor instance must be running on port 10853
- User should be able to make the get request  (status code 200) and the default policy must be running
- Response of post request must have 404 (Not Found) as status code and no policy must be created
